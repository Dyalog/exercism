# Contributing
This repository is intended to create the Dyalog APL track on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org). Right now are the very beginning stages of its creation.

This guide will help you to contribute in the most common scenarios.

## Bugs, typos and suggestions
For now, if you spot spelling errors, inconsistencies or other issues with existing exercises, or if you want to suggest an exercise but do not have the time to implement it yourself, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Dyalog/exercism/issues/new) on this GitHub repository.

## Improving the track
The [exercism docs](https://exercism.org/docs/building/tracks) lay out all of the possible aspects of a track. Currently the Dyalog APL track is working towards a set of basic instructions and some simple and common exercises for newcomers. Eventually we would like to have a self-contained track including the ability to edit and submit code on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org) and have submissions automatically validated with useful feedback.

## Tooling
We are still looking to implement a test runner for Dyalog APL on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org). If you are a keen member of the array language community with the appropriate knowledge, we'd love for you to set up our test runner. See the [exercism docs on creating a test runner](https://exercism.org/docs/building/tooling/test-runners/creating-from-scratch) for more information.
