# Learning Dyalog APL
The [APL Wiki page of Learning Resources](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Learning_resources) has links to many known tutorials, articles and videos aimed at introducing APL to newcomers. To help guide you, we have selected a few of them that are particularly useful to somebody wanting to learn APL from scratch.

## Video Introductions
These videos provide a flavour of what using APL and thinking in an array-oriented way are like.

[Will You Play APL With Me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6ofXSYTST8) introduces APL with an example of an array-oriented approach to justifying text - aligning character data as is common in word processors.

[The Heart of The Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O73HYH0p8eo) shows the basic syntax and how a few functions and operators create a terse solution that directly maps to the problem of determining which attendees watched some scheduled presentations.

## Tutorials
The [APL Challenge](https://challenge.dyalog.com/) is a gentle introduction to the language that assumes no prior knowledge of programming or APL. Solving problems enters you with the chance to win a cash prize.

Once you have gotten a flavour of APL with the challenge, you will be able to solve the most basic exercises on this track. To improve your knowledge and be able to handle more intermediate exercises, we recommend the following resources:

For those with no programming experience:
- [Mastering Dyalog APL](https://dyalogprod.gos.dyalog.com/learn/mastering-dyalog-apl/) is a comprehensive guide to both the APL language and the Dyalog development environments.
- [The APL Tutor](https://tutorial.dyalog.com/) is a well-loved, conversational tutorial that takes you through the foundations of APL including exercises in reading and writing APL.

For those with experience programming in another language:
- The Dyalog [APL Course](https://course.dyalog.com) is a set of guided problem sets with examples and explained solutions.
- [Learning APL](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/intro.html) by Stefan Kruger is an excellent introduction to modern APL for experienced programmers.
