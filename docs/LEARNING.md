# Learning Dyalog APL
The [APL Wiki page of Learning Resources](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Learning_resources) contains many tutorials, articles, and videos for beginners. We've selected the most helpful resources for people who want to learn APL from the beginning.

## Video Introductions
These videos show a little of what using APL is like and how to think about data in arrays.

[Will You Play APL With Me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6ofXSYTST8) introduces APL by showing how to align text - similar to what word processors do.

[The Heart of The Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O73HYH0p8eo) shows the basic rules of APL and how simple functions can solve complex problems, like tracking which people attended specific presentations.

## Tutorials
The [APL Challenge](https://challenge.dyalog.com/) is an easy introduction to the language. You don't need any previous knowledge of programming or APL. When you solve problems, you can also enter to win a cash prize.

Once you have tried the APL Challenge, you will be able to solve the basic exercises on this track. To learn more and solve intermediate exercises, we recommend these resources:
